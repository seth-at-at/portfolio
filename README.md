# Seth Moser - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I really wanted to learn the syntax of ruby going into this module but now I really want to get into TDD and get better at it.

## Rubric Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module:

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 2
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 2
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 2
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 3

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/themenintights/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

If this were the second week in it would be all 3's and 4's, for right now because this is the end of the mod all two's

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Programs that I've created to accomplish different tasks

#### (Enigma Project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/themenintights/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

Use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

ten tests, passing 2 not passing
there is no Enigma class
Decrupt and Encrypt class has a lot of code repetition, would like to have seen them treated as runners
Character map should be pulled out to separate class,
Application does not function

#####1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
#####2. Enumerable & Collections
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections
#####3. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
#####4. REPL Interface
* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult
#####5. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
#####6. Functional Expectations
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.

Thanks for helping me aginst my feelings of failure and dread.  I feel as well that our project taught us a lot.
  I think we should have talked and detailed more of a DTR than we did.  Primarily in the aspects of the time frames we planned
  to work together.  We ping ponged well and we made some great movements inbetween the hurdles.  You were seeing syntax errors 
  and a few other things along the same lines that I wasn't, if next time you could point that out and elaborate on it next time.
  I feel stronger after learning from this experience.

## D: Professional Skills
### Objectives:

* Understand and recognize the three triggers of feedback
* Define and understand the 3 different kinds of feedback
* Describe the process of how to navigate a feedback conversation
* Write out and deliver thoughtful feedback for your project partner

Learning about the three types of feedback really encourages you to look into your past and see how you reacted to what people have told you. Everyone consistantly believes they are in the right and will fight to defend themselves, but that's just not true. I have fallen victim to this as well and looking back there are times where I should have listened to the feedback I was being given but didn't, although, it does go both ways, there are times where you're correct and should argue back, but you won't know unless you actually listen to what you've been told, whether the feedback is correct or not.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is going for learning not just passing by memorization and good grades.
#### Cohort Norms
Being able to work with introverts/outroverts in an effective way and learning different way to deal with their types of practice/work.
#### Personal Stories / Connections
Learning that I could get a lot from pairing with people and helping just by asking questions, even if I don't know what their project is about allowing them to bounce ideas off you or you shooting in the dark can help more than nothing.
#### Grit Mindset
This one didn't seem that good too me, from what I understood it was that you just push through and finish something, if they had done mroe about only doing that if the quality stayed well then I would agree but from what I understood it was just going hard and finishing. Without a growth mindset this is not a good idea.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Link to Resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/ixw63ikpmhw)
* [Link to LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-moser-a84064134)

What I got from this was that I don't really know who I am, I'm still trying to figure that out. I love talkig to people and actually asking them what they think of me because it helps me ground myself and learn to improve from it.
#### Learning to Pair

Working with someone else in this field is much better than working alone. Doing a DTR and setting up a plan was probably the most helpful thing for starting a project with another person that I've ever done. Having a plan set in place and knowing how to contact and work with my partner was incredibly valuable.
#### Feedback

Feedback is important, it tells you how you can improve and when you give feedback you can even learn from what feedback you've given. Putting bad feedback inbetween two good feeback for a shit sandwhich can help keep people positive when hearing the bad feedback.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

You did well communicating in person and conveying your ideas. When we split up I could have used faster response times when using slack, esspecially when it was the night before it was due and we were trying to flush out the rest of our problems. When give the project it really helped a lot that you got it started and gave us something to work with. Although for the next project it would be really helpful if you included me with the beginning so I could see your thought process and how you came up with what you did. It would have really helped me learn more on how to start a project if I had seen that.

### Being a Community Member
  Thanks for helping me aginst my feelings of failure and dread.  I feel as well that our project taught us a lot.
  I think we should have talked and detailed more of a DTR than we did.  Primarily in the aspects of the time frames we planned
  to work together.  We ping ponged well and we made some great movements inbetween the hurdles.  You were seeing syntax errors 
  and a few other things along the same lines that I wasn't, if next time you could point that out and elaborate on it next time.
  I feel stronger after learning from this experience.

### Playing a Part
I reached out to people who needed pairing, helped others with their feelings towards projects and making them feel better about themsleves.
